The goal this library is to provide basic ORM features not covered by [Spring Data R2DBC](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-r2dbc).

Spring Data R2DBC states that
> This is NOT an ORM 

> it does NOT offer caching, lazy loading, write behind or many other features of ORM frameworks. This makes Spring Data R2DBC a simple, limited, opinionated object mapper

In another hand, [Hibernate Reactive](https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-reactive) is not yet released, and not integrated with Spring Data.

Waiting for a full ORM (like Hibernate), providing reactive streams to access to a relational database, and being integrated with Spring Data (with repositories...),
this library aims at providing the most useful features that are really missing from Spring Data R2DBC and that was provided by Spring Data JPA.

## Features

 - Lazy loading
 - Linked entities (1 to 1, 1 to n, n to 1)
 - Select statement with joins
 - Save (insert/update) with cascade
 - Delete with cascade
 - Schema generation

## Supported databases

 - H2
 - Postgres
 - MySql 

# Configuration

## Maven configuration

Add the Maven dependency, depending on your database:

### H2

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.lecousin.reactive-data-relational</groupId>
  <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Postgres

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.lecousin.reactive-data-relational</groupId>
  <artifactId>postgres</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### MySql

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.lecousin.reactive-data-relational</groupId>
  <artifactId>mysql</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Entities configuration: lc-reactive-data-relational.yaml

You have to declare the list of entity classes in YAML as resource file `lc-reactive-data-relational.yaml` (similar to file `persistence.xml` for JPA).
The classes are declared under the name `entities`, each level can declare a package, then leaf names are classes. For example:

```yaml
entities:
  - net.lecousin.reactive.data.relational.test:
    - simplemodel:
      - BooleanTypes
      - CharacterTypes
    - onetoonemodel:
      - MyEntity1
      - MySubEntity1
    - onetomanymodel:
      - RootEntity
      - SubEntity
      - SubEntity2
      - SubEntity3
```

The library needs to be initialized before any entity class is loaded, because it will rewrite entity classes (using javassist) to support features.
The initialization will use this configuration file to know which classes need to be enhanced.

## Spring Boot configuration

In your configuration class, you need to:
- add `@EnableR2dbcRepositories(repositoryFactoryBeanClass = LcR2dbcRepositoryFactoryBean.class)`
- launch the initializer `LcReactiveDataRelationalInitializer.init()` that will load your `lc-reactive-data-relational.yaml` configuration file, before your application starts.

Example:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableR2dbcRepositories(repositoryFactoryBeanClass = LcR2dbcRepositoryFactoryBean.class)
public class MyApp {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		LcReactiveDataRelationalInitializer.init();
		SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
	}

}
```

## JUnit 5

For your tests, using JUnit 5, you can use the annotation `@DataR2dbcTest` provided by Spring, and add the annotation `@EnableR2dbcRepositories(repositoryFactoryBeanClass = LcR2dbcRepositoryFactoryBean.class)`.

In addition, in order to make sure the initializer is launched before any test class is loaded, add the following maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.lecousin.reactive-data-relational</groupId>
  <artifactId>test-junit-5</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

This will automatically call `LcReactiveDataRelationalInitializer.init()` to load your `lc-reactive-data-relational.yaml` configuration file.

# Usage

## Entity class

You can decalre your entity classes in the same way as Spring Data R2DBC (with annotations `@Table` and `@Column`).
In addition, here are the following supported options:
- Annotation `org.springframework.data.annotation.Id` can be used to indicate a primary key
- Annotation `net.lecousin.reactive.data.relational.annotations.GeneratedValue` can be used to indicate the value should be generated by the database (auto increment)
- Annotation `org.springframework.data.annotation.Version` can be used for optimistic lock
- Annotation `net.lecousin.reactive.data.relational.annotations.ForeignKey` can be used to indicate a link. The cascade behavior can be specified using the 2 attributes `optional` and `onForeignKeyDeleted`. A foreign key cannot be used on a collection type.
- Annotation `net.lecousin.reactive.data.relational.annotations.ForeignTable` is the other side of the foreign key. It does not store anything in the database
but indicates the link to another class. A foreign table can be used on a collection type for a one to many link.

Additional methods may be declared in an Entity class to handle lazy loading, documented in the [dedicated section](#lazy-loading).

## Spring Repository

You can use Spring repositories as usual.
The methods to save and delete (such as `save`, `saveAll`, `delete`, `deleteAll`) will automatically be done with cascade.
However for find methods there are 2 different situations, which are described in the 2 following sections.

## Lazy loading

Spring Repository methods to find entities (`find...`) do not perform any join. If your class has links to other classes, they won't be loaded, however you can use lazy loading.

Lazy loading is done by declaring additional methods on your entity class, with a default body. The body will be automatically replaced with the correct code.

- On a @ForeignKey attribute, a class will be instantiated with the foreign key as id, all other attributes are not set.
- On a @ForeignTable attribute, the attribute will be null

Here are the methods you can add to handle lazy loading:
- You can declare a method `public boolean entityLoaded() { return false; }` to know if the entity instance is loaded or not.
- You can declare a method `public Mono<T> loadEntity() { return null; }` where T is your class, to load the entity. If the entity is already loaded, `Mono.just(this)`is returned.
- You can declare methods `public Mono<T> lazyGetXXX() { return null; }` to get a loaded entity on a @ForeignKey or @ForeignTable field XXX.
- For collections, the same method can be declared with a `Flux`: `public Flux<T> lazyGetXXX() { return null; }` to get entities from a collection with @ForeignTable

Example:

```java
@Table
public class Entity1 {

	@Id @GeneratedValue
	private Long id;

	@ForeignTable(joinKey = "entity1")
	private List<JoinEntity> links;

	[...]

	public List<JoinEntity> getLinks() {
		return links;
	}

	public void setLinks(List<JoinEntity> links) {
		this.links = links;
	}
	
	/** Load links. */
	public Flux<JoinEntity> lazyGetLinks() {
		return null;
	}
	
	/** Return true if this Entity1 is loaded from database. */
	public boolean entityLoaded() {
		return false;
	}
	
	/** Ensure this Entity1 is loaded from database before to use. */
	public Mono<Entity1> loadEntity() {
		return null;
	}
	
}
```

## Entity graph

Lazy loading is often not a good solution in term of performance.
The preferred solution is to load a graph of entities in a single database request, using joins.

In JPA, entity graphs are used. This library does not provide similar way to indicate which links need to be loaded,
but you can use the class `SelectQuery` in your repositories to perform more complex searches and load linked entities.

For example:

```java
public interface RootEntityRepository extends LcR2dbcRepository<RootEntity, Long> {

	/** Search RootEntity having the given value, and fetch sub entities 'list'. */
	default Flux<RootEntity> findByValue(String value) {
		return getLcClient().execute(SelectQuery.from(RootEntity.class, "entity").where(Criteria.property("entity", "value").is(value)).join("entity", "list", "sub"));
	}
	
	/** Search RootEntity with a sub-entity having the given value, and fetch sub entities. */
	default Flux<RootEntity> findBySubValue(String value) {
		return getLcClient().execute(SelectQuery.from(RootEntity.class, "entity").join("entity", "list", "sub").where(Criteria.property("sub", "subValue").is(value)));
	}

	/** Search RootEntity having the same value as one of its sub-entities. */	
	default Flux<RootEntity> havingSubValueEqualsToValue() {
		return getLcClient().execute(SelectQuery.from(RootEntity.class, "entity").join("entity", "list", "sub").where(Criteria.property("sub", "subValue").is("entity", "value")));
	}
	
	/** Get all RootEntity and fetch links 'list', 'list2' and 'list3'. */
	default Flux<RootEntity> findAllFull() {
		return getLcClient().execute(
			SelectQuery.from(RootEntity.class, "root")
			.join("root", "list", "sub1")
			.join("root", "list2", "sub2")
			.join("root", "list3", "sub3")
		);
	}

}
```

You can note the method `getLcClient()` needed to execute requests, which is automatically available if your repository extends `LcR2dbcRepository`.
If you don't need it, your repository can just extend the `R2dbcRepository` base interface of Spring.
